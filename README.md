# Continuous Integration And Continous Delivery/Deployment Pipeline

## Diagram Showing Overview of CI-CD Pipeline





## Definitions:

- Continous Integration (CI) -  developers making small changes and checks to their code. This process is automated to ensure that teams can build, test, and package their applications in a reliable and repeatable way. 

- Continuous Delivery (CD) - automated delivery of completed code to environments like testing and development. CD provides an automated and consistent way for code to be delivered to these environments.


- Continous Deployment (CD/CDE) -  next step of continuous delivery. Every change that passes the automated tests is automatically placed in production, resulting in many production deployments.


- Github - online code repository tool used as part of CI.  Provides hosting platform for version control and collaboration.


- Webhooks - listen to changes from developers and delivers messages to other services, for example Jenkins.

- Jenkins -  open source automation server, allows to reliably build, test, and deploy their software.

- Master Node > main server in jenkins involved in execution to Cloud after tests are passed in agents node or feedback to local host for potential issues. 

- Agent / Slave Node > Provide desiredtesting environment (javascript executables) as determined from master node.
